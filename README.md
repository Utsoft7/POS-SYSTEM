## Future Roadmap

This POS system is built to be scalable. The future roadmap includes:

-   **Multi-Restaurant Customization:** Evolve the platform into a SaaS model where different restaurants can sign up and customize the POS with their own branding, menu, and data.
-   **Advanced Analytics:** Introduce more detailed reports on sales, popular items, peak hours, and customer behavior.
-   **Inventory Management:** Add a module to track stock levels of ingredients and automatically flag items that are running low.
-   **User Roles & Permissions:** Implement distinct roles (e.g., Admin, Manager, Cashier, Waiter) with different levels of access and permissions.
-   **Waiter Mobile App:** Develop a companion mobile application for waiters to take orders directly from the table.
